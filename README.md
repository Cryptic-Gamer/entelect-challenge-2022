# entelect-challenge-2022
Just a very basic visualiser for the Entelect Challenge 2022

Using the Visualiser:
Copy any Match Replay file from the entelect challenge logger:
example: 
GameStateLog_2022-04-05_02-51-59_GameComplete.json

Rename the file to:
GameStateLog.json

If the visualiser.html file is in the same directory it will run the match, 
I will add some updates later if it is needed for my own development process (Like showing the state of scouting)

As a last note Im not very high on Graphicsl Development. 
Jus is just a bare minimum to get me started with the real fun.
